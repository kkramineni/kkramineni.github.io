### Hardware Requirements:
The minimum hardware requirements for pfSenseÂ® software on hardware are:

- 64-bit amd64 (x86-64) compatible CPU
- 1GB or more RAM - I've configured 512MB in Lab, which is enough for non network relted use cases
- 8 GB or larger disk drive (SSD, HDD, etc)
- 2 network interface cards
- Bootable USB drive or high capacity optical drive (DVD or BD) for initial installation
