##### MicroCloud
MicroCloud allows you to deploy your own fully functional cloud in minutes.

Itâ€™s a snap package that can automatically configure LXD, Ceph, and OVN across a set of servers. It relies on mDNS to automatically detect other servers on the network, making it possible to set up a complete cluster by running a single command on one of the machines.

MicroCloud creates a small footprint cluster of compute nodes with distributed storage and secure networking, optimized for repeatable, reliable remote deployments. MicroCloud is aimed at edge computing, and anyone in need of a small-scale private cloud.

###### Requirements:

MicroCloud requires a minimum of three machines.

*Networking requirements:*

For networking, MicroCloud requires a dedicated network interface and an uplink network that is an actual L2 subnet. See Networking for more information.

The IP addresses of the machines must not change after installation, so DHCP is not supported.

*Software requirements:*

MicroCloud requires snapd version 2.59 or newer.
