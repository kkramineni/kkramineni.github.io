Once VMware Workstation is installed, you can enjoy a fully functional virtualization platform for 30 days for free.

### Home Lab Explanation

As shown in the diagram, I have used the NAT network, which allows me to reach internet via my Laptop connected Wi-Fi Network

Also I have created a LAN segment in VMware workstation. This allows me to control and test any of the stuff like Firewall and DHCP, DNS etc.

###
> Can I install and configure without all these network related customisation ?
Yes, we can simply go ahead with default settings of VMware Workstation installation
